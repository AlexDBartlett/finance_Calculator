1. import math module
2. User should be able to choose a type of caculation
3. ask the user to enter a type of calculation using the given statement:

"investment - to calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment
bond - to calculate the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan

Enter either 'investment' or 'bond' from the menu above to proceed:"

4. Capitalisation should not affect how this runs. i.e  'Bond', 'bond', 'BOND' should all work.
5. if the user chose bond then ask for the following;
    - What is the value of the house
    - What is your interest rate?
    - How many months do you plan to repay?
6. Calculate the result using this formula: repayment = (i * P)/(1 - (1 + i)**(-n))
7. Print the result

8. If the user chose investment then ask for the following:
    - Ask the user how much money they are depoisiting
    - Ask the user the intereste rate as a percentage. (no percentage sign)
    - Ask the user the number of years they plan to invest.
    - Ask the user if they want "simple" or "Compound" interest and store as a variable called interest
    
9. If the user chose simple then calculate using the folowing formula: A = P * (1+r*t). Then print the result
10. If the user chose compound then calculate using the folowing formula: A = P * math.pow((1+r),t). Then print the result.

11. If the user did not enter either investement or bond in the beginning loop back to start and give error.
